excerpt: 'This paper evaluated China’s capital account liberalization and exchange rate marketization by integrating
carry trade into the Impossible Trinity framework. Built a theoretical model and using
TVP-SV-VAR analysis to examine the short- and long-term impulse responses between carry trade, capital
controls, exchange rate stability, and monetary policy independence. Findings revealed that carry trade
significantly impacts the independence of monetary policy, supporting a phased approach to capital account
liberalization, starting with Portfolio Investment, followed by Financial Derivatives and FDI accounts.'
