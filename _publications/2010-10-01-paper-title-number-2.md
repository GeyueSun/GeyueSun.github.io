Kong"

excerpt: 'Investigated the impact of the Shanghai Free Trade Area (FTA) on Hong Kong’s port economy using a
Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach and border analysis. The analysis revealed a crowding-out effect of
the Shanghai FTA on Hong Kong’s import-export market, attributed to Hong Kong’s dependence on sales
and import volume rather than production innovation and R&D capabilities.'
