excerpt: >**Advisor:** Prof. Tomas Williams  

This project investigates **commodity carry trade in developing countries**, testing two key hypotheses:  
1. **Commodity liquidity risk reduces carry trade returns** (impact: -0.226)  
2. **Capital controls amplify the negative impact of liquidity risk**  

A **Staggered-DID model** is employed using **4,000 daily capital intervention events** from the **Global Trade Alert (GTA) dataset**. A **Large Language Model (LLM)** extracts regional information from **25,035 commodity contracts** (Refinitiv), which is merged with **Bloomberg’s carry trade returns** to analyze liquidity risk's effect on returns. The project’s findings were **presented at the 2024 SEA Annual Meeting**, offering new insights into the **commodity-carry trade market equilibrium**.
