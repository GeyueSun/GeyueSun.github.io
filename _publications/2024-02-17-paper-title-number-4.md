excerpt: >
  **Advisor:** Prof. Tomas Williams  
  - Conducted empirical research on commodity carry trade in developing countries, testing two key hypotheses:  
    (1) Commodity liquidity risk significantly reduces carry trade returns (estimated impact: -0.226).  
    (2) The negative impact of liquidity risk is amplified by capital controls.  
  - Utilized a **Staggered-DID model** to investigate bypass mechanisms in response to diverse capital control policies. The analysis was based on **daily capital intervention data (4,000 events)** from the Global Trade Alert (GTA) dataset.  
  - Built a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to extract regional information from **25,035 commodity contracts** in the Refinitiv dataset. Merged this with Bloombergâ€™s daily carry trade returns to assess the influence of liquidity risk on carry trade returns and develop a quantitative model for the **commodity-carry trade market equilibrium**.  
  - **Presented at the 2024 Southern Economics Association (SEA) 94th Annual Meeting** on November 2024.
