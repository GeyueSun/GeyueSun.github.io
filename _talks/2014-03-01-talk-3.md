  **Joint work with:** [Prof. Tomas Williams](https://tomas-williams.com/)
  
This research project investigates the **commodity carry trade in developing countries**, with a focus on the interplay between **liquidity risk, capital controls, and carry trade returns**. The study tests two key hypotheses: (1) **Commodity liquidity risk significantly reduces carry trade returns** (estimated impact: -0.226), and (2) **The negative effect of liquidity risk is amplified in the presence of capital controls**. To empirically validate these hypotheses, the project employs a **Staggered-Difference-in-Differences (Staggered-DID) approach**, leveraging granular daily intervention data from **4,000 capital control events** in the **Global Trade Alert (GTA) dataset** to analyze the effects of capital control policies on carry trade returns.

The project also integrates data from multiple sources to support the analysis. A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is utilized to extract regional information from **25,035 commodity contracts** within the **Refinitiv dataset**, which is then merged with **Bloombergâ€™s daily carry trade returns**. This integration facilitates a comprehensive analysis of how **liquidity risk influences carry trade returns** and provides novel insights into the **equilibrium conditions of the commodity carry trade market**. The findings from this project were presented at the **94th Annual Meeting of the Southern Economics Association (SEA) in November 2024**, sparking discussions on the implications of **liquidity risk for international capital flows and commodity market dynamics**.
