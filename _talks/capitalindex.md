excerpt: >
  **Joint work with:** [Prof. Roberto Samaniego](https://robertosamaniego.weebly.com/)
  
  - Constructed a high-frequency daily **Capital Control Index** for 119 countries, capturing five categories of capital account interventions from **January 1, 2000 till today**. , this index enables real-time analysis of global capital control policies.  
  - Utilized machine learning techniques, including **Linear Regression** and **LASSO**, to enhance the precision of the Capital Control Index. The model was trained on the **Ka-open Index** from the IMF's **Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER)**.  
  - Built a dataset and a website to enable real-time updates and provide dynamic access to the dataset.
