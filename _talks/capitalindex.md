  **Joint work with:** [Prof. Roberto Samaniego](https://robertosamaniego.weebly.com/)

  This project focuses on the development of a **high-frequency Daily Capital Control Index** for **119 countries**, spanning from **January 1, 2000, to the present**. The index tracks **six categories of capital account interventions**, offering a **real-time tool** for the **tracking and analysis of global capital control policies**. By providing timely and granular insights, the index serves as a critical resource for researchers, policymakers, and market participants seeking to understand cross-country differences in capital control measures. 

  To ensure precision, the index employs **machine learning techniques**, including **Linear Regression** and **LASSO**, trained on the **Ka-open Index** from the IMFâ€™s **Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER)**. The project also includes the development of a **comprehensive dataset** and a **user-friendly website** that enables **real-time updates and dynamic access** to the dataset, facilitating seamless access to up-to-date capital control information.
